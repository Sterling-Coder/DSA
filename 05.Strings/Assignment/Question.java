/* Question 5
a)
The method intern() creates an exact copy of a String object in the heap memory
and stores it in the String constant pool. Note that, if another String with the 
same contents exists in the String constant pool, then a new object won't be created 
and the new reference will point to the other String.\

b)
Java StringBuffer class is used to create mutable (modifiable) String objects. 
The StringBuffer class in Java is the same as String class except it is mutable 
i.e. it can be changed.
